However, location and date published would be removed after they were extracted into separate columns as these 2 details should not be included in the processing/analysis of the main news texts.</p>

<p>From above, there are indeed quite a few pairs/groups of newsgroups with similar text sentiment profiles, e.g. The Abila Post and Central Bulletin had same sentiment scores. Could these pairs/groups be posting common or similar news articles to result in the same scores? If so, which are the primary and derivative sources? We will try to investigate this in the following analysis.</p>

<p>From above, we can observe that higher correlation between newsgroups is represented by the thickening and darkening of their edges with each other. For example, “The World” is at the centre of a sub-network of newsgroups and has expressedly stronger correlation with “Who What News”. In another sub-network group, “The Abila Post” showed stronger text correlation with “Central Bulletin”.</p>
<p>In total, we observed 5 separate sub-newsgroup networks led by 5 core newsgroups which we can infer as the primary news sources since they acted like a hub and showed strong correlation of 0.7 or more with other newsgroups in their networks. The 5 primary news sources are (1) “The Abila”, (2) “The World”, (3) “International Times”, (4) “Kronos Star”, and (5) “Homeland Illumination”. The other newsgroups surrounding these hubs are the derivative news sources.</p>

<p>With the above datatable, we would be able to identify the primary and derivative news sources for each highly correlated news article pairs (&gt;0.8 correlation) by comparing their published dates. The article with the earlier date would be the primary source as the later article would essentially be obtaining its text from the primary article after the primary article has been published.</p>

<p>It can be observed that the key POK personnels i.e., Bodrogi and Carmine elicited positive sentiment scores whilst others such as Elian and Juliana had negative sentiment scores with the reporting of their deaths. Government officials, Nespola and President Kapelou as well as GASTech CEO Sanjorge also have negative scores resulting from negative words frequently associated with their news. Marek, a POK member, also drew negative sentiment score due to the word “stop”, a word depicting obstraction.This will be investigated in the news texts later.</p>

<p>It is observed that WFA, an NGO, had positive sentiment scores in line with its supportive role in the community. The Government and POK have fairly balanced spread of positive and negative sentiment scores (from their associated bigram words) due to their advocations and the dramatic events that occurred. Notably, GASTech has word bigrams in the news texts that was skewed towards negative sentiment scores due to the issues of water contamination which purportedly caused harm to the lives of the people in the community.</p>

<p>Similarly, the above places have news sentiment scores varying in tandem with the events occuring in these places. For example, the numerous protests convened in Elodis resulted in negatively skewed sentiment scores on the associated word bigrams whilst the reported “help” provided to the rural areas resulted in positive word bigrams and corresponding sentiment score.</p>

<p>For events reported, the sentiment scores seem to be correct for most, i.e. negative sentiment associated with arrests, deaths, protests etc. However, for events such as disease and contamination, the associated words such as “responsible” and “increased” (which are classified by AFINN as positive sentiment words) may have incorrectly tilted the sentiment scores in the positive direction.</p>
